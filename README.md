# nRFICE
### nRF5340 with ICE40UP5K including JLink OB for instant BLE and FPGA development with zero dongles
In order to develop a number of comercial products, we needed a simple bluetooth 5 plus FPGA platform. nRFICE is meant to be a maximally simple solution for launching projects that require MCU plus FPGA and certainly if Bluetooth including mesh is needed.
### Arduino Uno compatibility
nRFICE is physically compatible with Arduino Uno shields, but take care that the GPIO level is 3.3V.
